# DOTS_SpaceShooter_MahdiJafari
Game is made very similar to one tutor made during lectures, i also did much of research in YouTube, The game runs well in editor but the build crashes every time and i have no clue why althogh code is fine, maybe i dont now how building is with DOTS.
Main scene is called "SampleScene" and "SpaceSubScene" in hierarchy must be activated in order to run the game.
